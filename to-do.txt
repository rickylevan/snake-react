--Improve aesthetics of game
--If connected to internet, prompt for username and password in pretty interrupt window
--Show top high scores all time
--Show user's current score and the user's personal highest score of all time

--Have a simple golang (w/ sql) server running in the cloud (or be cocky w no DB???)
--Server and client both able to async push events, so I think... Websockets!
	-- for example, someone getting a new high score can push immediately to everyone
	-- who is playing the game
